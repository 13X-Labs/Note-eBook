# eBooks

Hi there,

I'm currently working on a series of online books that cover a wide range of topics related to machine learning, computer science, signal processing, algorithms, and mathematics. While the books are still a work in progress, I have decided to publish them in parts so that I can receive early feedback and make improvements as I continue to work on them.

My goal is to share my knowledge with others and provide accessible resources for those interested in learning more about these complex topics. By publishing the content now rather than waiting until it's fully complete, I hope to provide readers with valuable insights and information that they can use today.

Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to hearing your feedback on my work.
