# Integers

The concept of integers, or whole numbers, is believed to have been developed in ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Indians. However, the concept of zero, which is crucial for the development of integers, was not introduced until much later.

In ancient Babylonian mathematics, a base-60 system was used, which allowed for the representation of large numbers using only a few symbols. In Egypt, a hieroglyphic system was used to represent numbers, with different symbols used for powers of ten. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta is credited with developing the modern concept of integers in the 7th century, which included the concept of negative numbers and the use of zero.

During the Middle Ages, Arabic numerals and the concept of zero were introduced to Europe through contact with Arab mathematicians. This led to the development of new mathematical systems and techniques, including the use of negative integers, fractions, and decimals.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, mathematicians such as Pierre de Fermat and Leonhard Euler made significant contributions to the study of integers and number theory. In the 19th century, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss introduced the concept of modular arithmetic, which is now widely used in cryptography and computer science.

Today, integers play a fundamental role in mathematics and are used in a wide range of applications, including computer programming, cryptography, and finance. The study of integers, known as number theory, remains an active area of research in mathematics.

## Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta

Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta ("Correctly Established [Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhanta) of [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma)", abbreviated BSS) is a great mathematical work of India, written by mathematician and astronomer Brahmagupta around the 7th century. This work includes chapters on algebra, geometry, and astronomy.

In Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Brahmagupta introduced important concepts of algebra, including negative numbers, zero, and quadratic equations. He also solved problems related to algebraic equations and provided formulas for basic geometric shapes, including triangles and squares.

He wrote, “[The sum] of two positives is positive, of two negatives negative; of a positive and a negative [the sum] is their difference; if they are equal it is zero.”

Thus, zero is obtained by adding a positive number to a negative of equal magnitude; for example, 1 + (–1). This is what is meant by the modern notation 1 – 1. Further, Brahmagupta wrote that adding zero does not change the sign of a number, that 0 + 0 = 0, and that any number times zero gives zero. However, he is not sure about division by zero.

## Pierre de Fermat

Pierre de Fermat was a famous mathematician in history, and he made significant contributions to number theory and the study of integers.

Fermat's theorem on prime numbers: 

1. If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
2. Fermat's theorem on perfect numbers: A positive integer $n$ is called a perfect number if it equals the sum of its positive divisors and is not equal to itself. Fermat proved that if $n$ is an odd perfect number, then it has the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $p$ and $2^p - 1$ are both prime numbers.
3. Fermat's theorem on the unique factorization of integers: Every positive integer $n$ can be uniquely factored into a product of prime numbers. Fermat proved that if $n$ is not a prime number, then it can be factored into a product of prime numbers in a unique way.

## Leonhard Euler

Leonhard Euler was a famous mathematician in history, and he made significant contributions to number theory and the study of integers.

1. Euler's theorem on prime numbers: A positive integer $n$ is a prime number if and only if $\varphi(n) = n-1$, where $\varphi(n)$ is the Euler function that counts the number of prime numbers less than $n$ and not divisible by $n$.
2. Wilson's theorem: Let $p$ be a prime number greater than $2$. Then $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$.
3. Fermat-Euler theorem: If $a$ and $n$ are two relatively prime positive integers, then $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, where $\varphi(n)$ is the Euler function.
4. Lagrange's theorem: Every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of non-repeating prime numbers.

## Carl Friedrich Gauss

Carl Friedrich Gauss was a famous mathematician and physicist in history, and he made significant contributions to number theory and the study of integers. Below are some important theorems of Gauss related to integers, explained using LaTeX mathematical notation:

1. Gauss's theorem on pure integers: A positive integer $n$ is called a pure integer if it has the form $x^2 + ny^2$ with $x, y$ being integers. Gauss proved that a positive integer $n$ is a pure integer if and only if $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ is a Euclidean domain.
2. Gauss's polynomial factorization theorem: Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Then there exists a polynomial $g(x)$ and a positive integer $h$ such that $f(x)g(x) \equiv 1 \pmod{x^h}$.
3. Gauss's theorem on representation of integers by primes: Every integer can be expressed as the sum of at most 3 prime numbers.

These theorems have had a significant impact on the development of number theory and the study of integers, and are widely used in many practical applications.

## Computer Science

Euler's and Fermat's contributions to number theory have had significant impacts on computer science. Here are a few examples:

1. Cryptography: The RSA cryptosystem, one of the most widely used encryption methods in computer security, is based on the mathematical concepts of Euler's totient function and Fermat's little theorem. RSA encryption relies on the fact that it is computationally infeasible to factor large composite numbers into their prime factors, which is related to Fermat's theorem on factorization of integers.
2. Algorithm design: Euler's graph theory has had a profound impact on algorithm design. Many algorithms in computer science, including Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow, are based on Euler's ideas about graphs and networks.
3. Numerical methods: Gauss's work on numerical analysis has had a significant impact on computer science, particularly in the development of numerical methods for solving differential equations and optimization problems. Gauss's method for solving linear systems of equations, also known as Gaussian elimination, is widely used in computer graphics and computer vision.

Overall, the contributions of Euler and Fermat to number theory have had far-reaching impacts on computer science, and continue to inspire new research and applications in the field.

## Artificial intelligence

Euler's and Fermat's contributions to mathematics have also had important applications in artificial intelligence (AI). Here are a few examples:

1. Probability theory: Euler's work on probability theory, including his formulation of the famous Euler's number, has had a significant impact on the development of AI algorithms that rely on probabilistic models, such as Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models. These models are used in a wide range of applications, from natural language processing to computer vision.
2. Machine learning: Fermat's work on optimization has had a profound impact on machine learning algorithms, particularly in the development of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are used in many applications of machine learning, including image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The optimization techniques used in SVMs are based on Fermat's ideas about finding optimal solutions to mathematical problems.
3. Control theory: Euler's work on dynamical systems and control theory has also had important applications in AI, particularly in the development of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in robotics, game AI, and other applications where an agent must learn to make decisions based on feedback from its environment. The control theory concepts developed by Euler have been applied to the design of feedback controllers for these systems.

Overall, the contributions of Euler and Fermat to mathematics have had important applications in AI, and continue to inspire new research and applications in the field.

### *Example Fermat’s in Machine Learning*

Fermat's work on optimization provided important insights into the theory of Lagrange multipliers and convex optimization, which have been applied to the development of SVMs and other machine learning algorithms.

Fermat's work on optimization has had a profound impact on machine learning algorithms, particularly in the development of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks.

SVMs work by finding a hyperplane that separates the data into different classes, with the largest possible margin between the hyperplane and the closest data points. This margin is maximized by solving an optimization problem, which can be formulated as:

$\min _{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2$

subject to:

$y_i\left(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i+b\right) \geq 1 \quad \forall i=1, \ldots, n$

where $\mathbf{w}$ is a vector of weights, $b$ is a bias term, $\mathbf{x}_i$ is a data point, $y_i$ is its label, and $n$ is the number of data points.

This optimization problem can be solved using Lagrange multipliers and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, which involve finding the saddle point of a Lagrangian function. This is where Fermat's work on optimization comes into play.

Specifically, the optimization problem for SVMs can be reformulated as a dual problem, which involves maximizing a function over a set of Lagrange multipliers. This problem can be solved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, which state that the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the primal variables must be equal to zero, and the Lagrange multipliers must satisfy certain constraints.

The resulting dual problem can be written as:

$\begin{aligned}& \max \alpha \sum{i=1}^n \alpha_i-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i, j=1}^n y_i y_j \alpha_i\alpha_j\left\langle\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j\right\rangle \\\end{aligned}$

subject to:

$\alpha_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i=1, \ldots, n$

and

$\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \alpha_i=0$

where $\alpha_i$ are the Lagrange multipliers.

Solving this dual problem using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions gives us the optimal weights $\mathbf{w}$ and bias $b$ for the SVM. This optimization problem is at the heart of SVMs, and Fermat's work on optimization played an important role in its development.

With the improvements of Fermat, SVMs have become one of the most popular methods for classification and regression problems in machine learning. SVMs use a kernel function to map input data to a higher-dimensional space, where they can be classified by a hyperplane. The data points that lie farthest from the two margins of the hyperplane are called support vectors, and they provide important information for determining the position of the hyperplane.

Fermat's theorems are used in solving the optimization problem to find the best hyperplane. To minimize the loss function, SVMs use the Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization method, which is an optimization problem of a quadratic function with linear constraints. Fermat developed a method for solving quadratic equations, and his theorems on prime numbers were applied to develop methods for solving polynomial equations.

Mathematically, using Fermat's theorems to optimize SVMs can be complex, but they are widely applied in popular machine learning libraries such as LIBSVM and Scikit-learn. Using SVMs and Fermat's theorems, we can solve many different classification and regression problems in machine learning, including text classification, image recognition, and price prediction
